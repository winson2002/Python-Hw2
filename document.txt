A few months ago, I decided to deaccession an assortment of my things by 
whatever means feasible: selling, donating, recycling, giving them away, 
losing them on the subway, or reserving a spot for them on the next Mars 
Explorer. I gathered my unwanteds and piled them in the living room. A 
fraction of what was in that jumble: seven antique glass cake stands that 
belonged to my mother; a dormitoryâ€™s worth of new sheet sets and 
blankets for a bed size that is not mine; a set of Lenox china that my 
grandmother gave to my mother, who gave it to me, and was never used; 
clothes galore; a Viking stove grate that arrived cracked, and which I 
saved because I planned to weld it into a sculpture someday, after I 
learned how to weld; several rolls of Trump toilet paper that I wrongly 
thought were amusing a few years ago. I wish I could have added my 
boyfriendâ€™s too large Le Corbusier lounger. (There are Web sites, such 
as NeverLikedItAnyway.com, that will buy your exâ€™s leavings, ranging 
from engagement rings to â€œRick and Mortyâ€ socks.)
